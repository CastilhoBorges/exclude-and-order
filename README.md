# Script for sorting and removing duplicates in locale objects (i18n)

## Description

I was working on a feature at work that involved sorting internationalization (i18n) locale files. It was an old pull request that had been inactive for quite some time, and when I tried to resume it and merge it with the current main branch, I ended up with over 1000 lines of conflicts â€” considering the file normally had around 1600 lines.

To avoid the chaos of resolving everything manually, I created a script where I could simply copy the locale object and paste it directly into the code. The script removes duplicate values (keeping the first occurrence) and sorts all keys alphabetically.

In the end, it generates a .js file with the processed object.

## How to use

### 1. Clone or copy the script

Save the file as `sort-locales.js`, for example.

### 2. Paste the i18n object into the script

In the section below in the script, replace `object` with your translation object:

```js
const object = {
  welcome: 'Welcome',
  goodbye: 'Goodbye',
  other: 'Welcome', // Duplicate value
  ...
};
```

### 3. Run the script with Node.js

In the terminal, run:

```bash
node sort-locales.js
```

### 4. See the result

A folder called `result/` will be created with an `output.js` file containing:

- Alphabetically sorted keys.
- Duplicate values removed (keeping the first one).
- Standard Node export format (`module.exports = { ... }`).
- Keys without quotes, values with single quotes.

Example output:

```js
module.exports = {
  goodbye: 'Goodbye',
  welcome: 'Welcome',
};
```

## What the script does

- Removes duplicate values from the object (keeping the first key found).
- Sorts all keys alphabetically.
- Generates a JavaScript file in a readable format.
- Creates the result folder automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Why this was useful

- Avoided hours of manually resolving conflicts in huge locale files.
- Ensures the file is clean and consistent.
- Helps keep translations organized and easy to maintain.

## Requirements

- Node.js installed on the machine.
